🐱 Danielle Dockery — My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer & designer portfolio!
This site was built to showcase my projects, creativity, and personality in one interactive, hand-coded space.

✨ About

It’s built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and a touch of JavaScript for interactivity.
Every page is styled to match my personal aesthetic — minimal, clean, and cozy.
